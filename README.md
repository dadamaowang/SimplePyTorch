# PyTorch Lead in : An awesome toturial for beginners on how to implement learning system using PyTorch

This repo helps those starters on PyTorch and ML to understand the basic of neural networks and deep learning. 

Specificly, this repo is a note from a series of video toturial, here is the link of the author Hongpu Liu:

## Overview

AI, namely Artificial Intelligence, is trying to make machine working and studying like human. 

Machine Learning is a technology to realize AI

In the field of Machine Learning ,there are several method, including Deep Learning.

![README01](C:\shelf\Projects\PytorchLeadIn\pics\README01.PNG)

representation learning: learning representations of the data that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors.

namely, to generate __feature__



```
AI must fundamentally understand the world around us, and we argue that this can only be achieved if it can learn to identify and disentangle the underlying explanatory factors hidden in the observed milieu of low-level sensory data.

disentangle  v. 理顺
milieu n.周围环境
```

why PyTorch? PyTorch is a python package that provides two high-level features:

- Tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep Neural Network built on a tape-based autodiff system
